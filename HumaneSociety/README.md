# HumaneSociety

Welcome to the unofficial Humane Society CLI gem!

This CLI app scrapes the Hornell Humane Society Donations page at: https://www.hornellanimalshelter.org/donate.html.

Users have the option of viewing the information regarding financial donations as well as supplies needed to maintain the facility and the well being of the animals housed there.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'HumaneSociety'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install HumaneSociety

## Usage

To use this gem follow the installation instructions above. The original code is for giving information regarding donation options for the humane society website. Feel free to edit according to your needs.

To run the CLI, type in ./bin/humanesociety, which will give you instructions to choose options regarding donations to the Hornell Humane Society.

When you are finished reviewing the lists, type 'exit' to exit the CLI.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
